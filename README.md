Modelling cryptoeconomic systems based on blockchain

Some of the key questions to model
1. How does release schedule of a token affect the ability of the project to achieve its goals?
2. What is the ideal number of tokens to be issued?
3. How do you model the behavior of different players?
4. What is the best language for modelling this - there are other areas in which people have done modelling - like brain modelling in neuroscience, network traffic modelling in communcations research.
5. Ideally the approach should be -
   a. Find a system to model and model it manually
   b. Generalise this modelling system
6. How do decisions taken while designing the system affect the behaviour of the system.
   For this we would have to assume models for players of the system. How well we are bale to model the players would determine the modelling ability of the system
